        The Lorem ipsum text is derived from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of
        Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum. The physical source may
        have been the 1914 Loeb Classical Library edition of De finibus, where
        the Latin text, presented on the left-hand (even) pages, breaks off on
        page 34 with "Neque porro quisquam est qui do-" and continues on page 36
        with "lorem ipsum ...", suggesting that the galley type of that page was
        mixed up to make the dummy text seen today.
